KEY STEPS: Sear beef super quickly for maximum juiciness and use a large skillet (for quick sear + fast sauce reduction).\u00a0Stroganoff calls for good beef but if you only have a budget cut, use this easy Chinese method to tenderise the beef (it&#x27;s called &quot;velveting&quot;). It&#x27;s life changing - and perfect for Stroganoff.",

I added Worcestershire, garlic powder (reminded me of my college days before I had ever heard of mirepoix), more salt that I would prefer to consume, and some dried rosemary.  The rosemary was unconventional but worked nicely.  \r\n\r\nI will keep the searing advice, but likely use a different recipe next time.",

So easy to make and I like that it doesn\u2019t require white wine because a) I didn\u2019t have any and b) my toddler couldn\u2019t get enough of the sauce! Brilliant recipe, thank you.",
